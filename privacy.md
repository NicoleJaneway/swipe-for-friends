### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse Knap Apps or its use of the work. It is Knap Apps' policy to respect your privacy regarding any PII we may collect while operating our apps.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact nicolejanewaybills@gmail.com

### Application Users

Like most application developers, Knap Apps collects PII.  The amount and type of information that Knap Apps gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Knap Apps collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction. Knap Apps does not disclose PII other than as described below. Users can always refuse to supply PII, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.


### Aggregated Statistics

Knap Apps may collect and publish aggregated statistics about the behavior of users of the Service. For instance, Knap Apps may monitor the most popular features of the app. Knap Apps may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Knap Apps does not disclose PII other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Knap Apps discloses PII only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Knap Apps' behalf or to provide services through Knap Apps' applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Knap Apps will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Knap Apps discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Knap Apps believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Knap Apps, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Knap Apps may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Knap Apps and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Knap Apps takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Data Storage
Knap Apps uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Knap Apps may change its Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Knap Apps encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
